	<h1><center><u><i>PROGRAMING LANGUAGES</u></center></h1></i>
	<p><font color="blue">A programming language is a formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. Programming languages generally consist of instructions for a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs that implement specific algorithms.</font></p>

	<h2><center><u><i>C++</u></i></center></h2>
	<p><font color="blue">C++ (pronounced cee plus plus /ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/) is a general-purpose programming language. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation.</font></p>

	<h2><center><u><i>C</center></u></i></h2>
	<p><font color="blue">C (/ˈsiː/, as in the letter c) is a general-purpose, imperative computer programming language, supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope and recursion, while a static type system prevents many unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, and therefore it has found lasting use in applications that had formerly been coded in assembly language, including operating systems, as well as various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers to embedded systems.</font></p>

	<h2><center><u><i>JAVA</i></center></u></h2>
	<p><font color="blue">Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[14] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[15] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.[16] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. </font>

	<h2><center><u><i>OXYGEN</center></i></u></h2>
	<p><font color="blue">Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds.[3] By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium.[4]</font></p>
